# VIIRS_fire_detection
This project analyses VIIRS data. It includes a jupyter notebook with R kernel and the necessary files to run the script.
The analysis includes an overview of the fires detected over a 7 day period in two selected regions (South America and central Africa), considering properties of the fires, the countries they are detected at and the biome they affect.
